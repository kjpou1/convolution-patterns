## 🧠 Insight Summary

In CNN-based image classification for Forex pattern recognition, we observed a critical generalization failure tied to the semantics of **base/quote currency structure**.

### 🧩 What Happened

While visually similar, pattern shapes (e.g., pullbacks or trend reversals) reverse meaning across pairs like:

- **EURCAD** (CAD is quote): Uptrend = CAD weakening  
- **CADJPY** (CAD is base): Uptrend = CAD strengthening

A pullback pattern might **look identical** but mean different things depending on the pair's orientation.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

> The model sees the same **visual indicator structure** labeled as two different classes across instruments.  
> This introduces conflicts — **label noise** — that CNNs cannot resolve without explicit direction context.

CNNs are not inherently aware of instrument metadata. The same visual pattern gets labeled differently across instruments — the model has no way to reconcile that.

---

## 📊 How It Was Discovered

This insight only became apparent after:

- Building a consistent **baseline training evaluation framework**
- Tracking **metric evolution** across runs where pattern labels were added per instrument
- Noting sudden drops in generalization when pairs like CADJPY were introduced

---

## ✅ Takeaway

A CNN cannot reliably learn directional pattern semantics in multi-currency Forex data unless:

- Labels are **normalized to a canonical directional convention** (e.g., quote-currency view)  
- Or instrument **polarity is explicitly encoded** during training

---

## 💡 Future Directions

- Implement **canonical label normalization pass** for all directional classes  
- Optionally augment the model with **instrument embeddings** to provide context  
- Preserve current datasets for potential **instrument-specific or polarity-aware training**

## 🧾 Notes

This was a hypothesis early in the project, but data volume was insufficient to confirm. Only after building the comparison tooling and running controlled experiments did the failure mode become clear.

This insight now guides a pivot in data pipeline strategy for the Convolution Pattern Classifier.
